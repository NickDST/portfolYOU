- title: Visiting Research Scholar for Harvard Medical School Department of Biomedical Informatics
  from: June 2022
  to: Present
  description: • Accepted as a visiting research fellow at Harvard DBMI through a highly competitive application process.<br>
                • Currently developing a novel machine learning architecture to deal with missing and imbalanced modalities. Conducted extensive evaluation with dozens of hyperparameter sweeps to benchmark and rigorously validate the model at various points.





- title: Research Associate at the Structural Systems Biology Lab at Biodesign Institute
  from: May 2020
  to: Present
  description: Worked as a Research Associate in the Singharoy Lab. Lead research for my honors thesis to utilize deep ML methods with statistical mechanical methodologies. <br>  <br> 
                • Lead the development of using reinforcement learning algorithms alongside NAMD molecular dynamics sims for biologically relevant pathways. <br>
                • Enhanced and accelerated the differentiable simulator TorchMD into JAX in order to lever- age the JIT computation and ran differentiable simulations on biomolecules. Up to 20 times computational speedup even without using the parallelizability on GPU. <br>
                • Contributed to developing and testing a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network to generate minimum action pathways for dynamics. <br>
                • Implemented and used deep learning models to evolve noisy dynamical molecular systems using Neural SDEs, Graph Neural Networks, Hamiltonian Neural Networks, and more. <br>
                # • Used a mix of TCL, Python, and shell scripts to deploy molecular dynamic simulations in order to see how conformational changes on Hexokinase 1 influence its binding mechanisms with the mitochondria. I aim to better understanding the biological mechanisms that mitochondria function by in order to eventually better understand how to maintain proper mitochondrial distributions in neurons to combat neurodegenerative diseases.<br>

- title: Undergraduate Summer Research Intern at Carnegie Mellon
  from: June 2021
  to: August 2021
  description: •	Accepted as a visiting research fellow in CMU Statistics through a highly competitive summer research program. <br>
                • Created and a novel methodology for using stochastic simulators for soccer game predictions. Our method had comparable results to models trained directly on scores.
