  description: Developed deep learning models to evolve noisy dynamical molecular systems using Neural SDEs, Graph Neural Networks, Hamiltonian Neural Networks, and more. 
                • Utilizing Reinforcement Learning to explore protein conformational space.
                • Helped develop a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network to generate minimum action pathways for dynamics.
                • Did extensive testing on the model capacity of LSTMs to be used to evolve a dynamical system.
                • Under the guidance of John Vant, I've been using a mix of TCL, Python, and shell scripts to deploy molecular dynamic simulations in order to see how conformational changes on Hexokinase 1 influence its binding mechanisms with the mitochondria. I aim to better understanding the biological mechanisms that mitochondria function by in order to eventually better understand how to maintain proper mitochondrial distributions in neurons to combat neurodegenerative diseases.
