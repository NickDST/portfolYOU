# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am a computer science and mathematics undergraduate at Arizona State University. My career goal is to pursue a PhD in using multimodal and multiscale ML tools for studying biological systems and drug development. 

I work with Professor Abhishek Singharoy for structural systems biology and looking at ways to use ML and RL to drive SMD simulations. I also work with Professor Marinka Zitnik and Harvard Medical for drug-drug interaction prediction!
