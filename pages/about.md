Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I also have experience working with computational genomic analysis, full stack web development using various different frameworks and backends, data analysis and visualization with Javascript and Python, developing IOT systems with micro-controllers and cloud computing on Google Cloud Platform.
